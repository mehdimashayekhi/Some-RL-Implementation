# PPO

- Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347
- `python3 learn.py configs/data/ppo-cartpole-v1.json` runs the algorithm with default parameters from config file.

- P.S.: This is a simplified implementation of PPO paper based on open ai baseline. Also some classes of the current implementation are borrowd from https://github.com/lilianweng/deep-reinforcement-learning-gym
