this is partial implementation of the paper (Neural Network Dynamics
for Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model-Free Fine-Tuning) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02596.pdf, To run the program, launch with python ```main.py -n 15 -ep 300 -m 10 -sp 500 -r 100 -d 10 (fast) or python main.py -n 15 -ep 1000```
